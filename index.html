						<span class="title">Critical Issue on IT Equipment/Servers</span>
						<h3>June 12</h3>

<h4>PM</h4>

<ul>
<li>Our sensors has reported reaching temperatures of 30c and 39c in the cold and host aisle respectively. </li>
<li><p>We have shutdown storage services (maria, pmsat-nas, and pl2-storage). Other services are still up.</p>

<h4>AM</h4></li>
<li><p>The servers are up at the moment, but they may experience emergency shutdown within the day. Please try to retrieve the data you need before that. The shutdown usually happens around 12~1 PM when the temperature starts to rise, but it may occur before that. </p></li>
<li>We may shut down the storage services (Maria, PMSAT, and PL2-storage) on 1 PM today. The servers may also shutdown before this time due to them reaching critical temperatures. The FTP server has already experience an emergency shutdown.</li>
</ul>

<h3>June 10</h3>

<ul>
<li>Unfortunately, the ACs are experiencing the same problem again. We will contact Ralgo as soon as possible, but they probably will be available on June 13, Tuesday. We will keep the public-facing services (LiPAD, FTP, DREAM website) up, since the ambient temperature is cool due to the current weather.</li>
<li>We will, however, completely shutdown all services on June 11-12, Sunday and Monday, starting 9 AM of June 12, for the installation of electrical and power lines in NEC RM 318.</li>
</ul>

<h3>June 8</h3>

<ul>
<li>As of 11am: Issue with PL2 websites was due to wrong mapping of the network drive. Issue was fixed by reconfiguring and restarting the server.</li>
</ul>

<h3>June 7</h3>

<h4>Last leg of restoration</h4>

<ul>
<li>As of 10:50pm: All services are restored except PL2 websites. They cannot be accessed remotely. They will be fixed June 8.</li>
<li>As of 9pm: Ceph-hosted services not starting up, consisting of FTP , LiPAD Test VMs, and LiPAD Production VMs. This was traced to wrong network configuration. Services were restarted to fix the issue.</li>
<li>As of 8pm: All physical servers are up. Upon checking the virtual machines were not starting up. This issue was traced back to a recent network reconfiguration and was fixed.</li>
</ul>

<h4>PM</h4>

<ul>
<li>Repair was interrupted by the afternoon rain, but was completed by 7 PM</li>
<li>ACs were checked and are working again</li>
<li>ACs will be left turned on overnight, to see if anything else will come up</li>
<li>Services are being restored as the temperatures stabilize</li>
</ul>

<h4>AM</h4>

<ul>
<li>Repairs resumed at 8 AM</li>
<li>AC directly outside conference room was also assessed, also has a leaking pipe.</li>
<li>Repairs on the inverter outside also paused around 9:30 due to rain and need for resupply from Ralgo office.</li>
</ul>

<h3>June 6</h3>

<ul>
<li>As of 7 PM, visibility is too low for repairs, even with lights from their service vehicle. They will continue tomorrow early morning.</li>
<li>We sincerely apologize, servicing the AC is taking longer than expected due to the following reasons: * Piping has several cracks, most probably due to old age, and due to friction with the metal casing of the compressor. Cracks need to be welded. Additional equipment needed to be requested from Ralgo office for this. * Oil Separator also has a crack at the bottom, and there was difficulty in removing the Oil Separator for welding due to a stuck screw. * Oil Separator needs to welded thickly, as the crack seems to be larger than expected. It was recommended that this part should be replaced soon. * As of 6 PM, they are still welding.</li>
<li>AC VRF/Condenser is currently being serviced. ACs are expected to be working this afternoon, and services will be restored after.</li>
</ul>

<h3>June 5</h3>

<ul>
<li>Followed up on AC repair. Supply of Freon needs written request and approval from Ralgo management. Request has been submitted by the technician, specifying urgent need. Will follow up again this afternoon.</li>
</ul>

<h3>June 3 Update</h3>

<h4>As of 12 Noon:</h4>

<ul>
<li>AC Technician has visited and inspected the ACs.</li>
<li>The Panasonic Split-Type ACs' VRF/condenser has no more refrigerant, and some oil leakage is observed.</li>
<li>Technician cannot proceed with repair, since supplies have to be requested from their office, and is closed during the weekend</li>
<li>Next step to proceed this Monday, June 5. Will follow-up on the earliest possible time on this date.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Plan for June 3</h3>

<ul>
<li>Expected revisit of AC maintenance with technician, but as of now no tentative time for the visit. We will be monitoring their progress during the maintenance.</li>
<li>After the maintenance, the Server Room temperature will be monitored. If temperature has stabilized, the then we will resume services one by one.</li>
</ul>

<h3>June 2</h3>

<ul>
<li>AC maintenance personnel arrived. Although cleaning of AC filters and check up of AC are done, problem was not resolved. A technician needs to inspect the AC compressor. Earlier today they said the technician will arrive later this afternoon, but upon follow up they said no technician is available and to resched tomorrow June 3 morning.</li>
<li>Resumption of some services postponed because there was no available AC technician. Following up again due to urgency of this issue.</li>
<li>Base temperature of 28 celsius in the cold aisle, and 34 celsius in the hot aisle has been recorded by our sensors.</li>
<li>As of 12:30pm, all services has been shut down except core network connectivity to prevent disk damages</li>
</ul>

<h3>June 1</h3>

<ul>
<li>In the morning, ACs in the Chief’s Area, the Conference Room, and the FMC area have been faulty. Server Room temperatures are still below the threshold.</li>
<li>In the afternoon, we noted increasing temperatures in the server room and nearing the threshold. At 4:25 PM, we announced that some services will experience emergency shutdown due to equipment reaching critical temperatures. Ceph and PL2-backup have been shut down because their disks have reached the threshold temperature.</li>
<li>As of 5:56pm, base temperature of 30 celsius in the hot aisle has been recorded by our sensors. Normal temperatures should be 21/27 celsius, in the cold and hot aisles respectively. Internal disk operating temperatures of servers are estimated to be base room temperature plus 10 to 15 celsius, and more servers reported reaching 45 celsius triggering emergency shutdown procedures. We proceeded to shut down all remaining storage services.</li>
<li>AC maintenance scheduled at June 2 morning. Services to resume normal operation after this.</li>
</ul>

<h3>May 28</h3>

<ul>
<li>Fluctuations of electricity in the Diliman area, more than the usual expected. The UPS has been compensating for the power fluctuations by utilizing battery power, but we suspect that these fluctuations may have affected the ACs’ compressor, resulting in the events of June 1.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Overview</h3>

<ul>
<li>Since June 1, 2017, the Air Conditioners (ACs) in the office, specifically those in the Chief’s Area, Conference Room, and the FMC Area, and the Server Room of the 3rd floor office have been failing to provide sufficient cooling. As a result, the Server Room’s temperature has significantly increased, and our monitors have alerted us that the equipment inside are reaching critical temperatures on the afternoon of June 1. We had hoped that the issue with the ACs would be fixed today, June 2, but the maintenance has been postponed to tomorrow, June 3, due to unavailability of a technician to fix the problem. We are constantly monitoring the status of the equipment, and we can only resume the downed services once the ACs have been fixed.</li>
</ul>
